<p style="text-align: center; font-size: small;">This is an old post I'm reproducing here as part of my old blog migration. Since I wrote this post<br>I changed my habits quite a bit but the article is still valid as last time I checked using Fish as the default shell<br>in my Fedora 23 system I couldn't log into the X session</p>

<p style="font-size: x-large; text-align: center;">Why you shouldn't set <a href="https://www.fishshell.com">Fish</a> as the default shell
<br><span style="font-size: large;">Tip: it's ok though to set it as your <b>primary</b> shell</span>
</p>

<p>When I decided barely a month ago to finally move from Bash to Zsh I did remember about Fish, a shell I had tried in the past but ultimately left to test later as I didn't had the time at that opportunity to dive into it the way I pretended.</p>

<p>When I finally got a whole weekend for a n3rd sprint I deeply, desperately, passionately and unconditionally fell in love with Fish.</p>

<p>Right straight after reading Fish's website I could sense this would be the beginning of something special, as reading about it's design argument I felt the same way as when I read about <a href="">The Arch Way</a> some years ago and fell in love with the distro.</p>

<p>I believe the best way I can present this Friendly Interactive Shell is by describing it as <strong>an intelligent shell that works as an extension of the user in an organic and natural way</strong>:</p>
