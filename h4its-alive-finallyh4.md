#### It's alive (finally!)

I can't believe that it took me so much time to set this up.

I have to warmly thank **Ezequiel** who was the one who introduced me to BashBlog last year when I attended the annual FUDCon (Fedora Users and Developers Conference) that was held in CÃ³rdoba, Argentina in September. And talking about the event... what a nice memories, I was amazingly lucky to meet a lot of incredible folks. But enough for now, I will be writing about the FUDCon and what the Fedora community is all about in a later post - better later than never, right?


About me: n3rd. SysAdmin. Unix and F/LOSS lover. Surf 4 life, pura vida!

A final note: the answer to life and everything else isn't **42** as Mr. Douglas Adams incorrectly pointed out, it is **aliens**, as everybody knows.
