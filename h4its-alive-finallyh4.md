#### It's alive (finally!)

I can't believe that it took me so much time to set this up! I have to warmly thanks **Ezequiel** who was the one who introduced me to BashBlog last year when I attended the annual FUDCon (Fedora Users and Developers Conference) that was held in CÃ³rdoba, Argentina in September. And talking about the event... what a nice memories, I was incredible lucky to meet a lot of incredible folks. But enough for now, I will be writing about the FUDCon and what the Fedora community is all about in a later post - better later than never, right?

Back on track, some of the topics I pretend to post about in **error 404** are:
Finland, Japan, surfing, Fedora, infrastructure, Emacs, Go, electronic music, sharing, free culture, Apple / Mac OS, long haired German Shepherd, games, command-not-found, metal music, Battle Beast, Arch Linux, security, automation, Fish shell, tmux, natural and healthy foods, Atom.io, Weechat, software release rngineering, GNU+Linux, *BSD, hard rock music, philosophy, some rants, biking, beer, vodka, futurology, books, movies, reviews, F/LOSS, travel, privacy, Deep Purple Mk 2 (you know that's the only one), bitcoins, Spacemacs, Archive (the band), cyberpunk, 311, systems architecture, English language, Finnish culture, Japanese culture. Spanish language, Argentina, running, cooking, stray notes, cheatsheets, 8-bits, animal welfare, economy, Family Guy, Seinfeld, Louis C.K., Carlin, Bill Hicks, Monty Python, Python, Carl Sagan, Alicia Vikander, Mr. Robot, FSF, Dilbert (old stuff including the awesome TV show), speed cars, planes specially seaplanes, Microsucks Flight Simulator, web comics, One Small Step, Yahtzee!

... and pretty much everything else that catches my attention or I consider interesting enough to publicly archive.


##### About me
n3rd. SysAdmin. Unix, F/LOSS, Emacs, tmux, fish, Arch and Fedora lover. Surf 4 life, pura vida!
To be completed...

A final note: the answer to life and everything else isn't **42** as Mr. Douglas Adams incorrectly pointed out, it is **aliens**, as everybody knows.
