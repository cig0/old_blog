We are in business (finally)

**About me**                                                                             
I'm i90rr. I'm a n3rd. I'm also a SysAdmin, a Unix(-like) and F/LOSS admirer and contributor. If I were a religious person my religion would be surf. Surfing is a state of mind - like Zen. When you surf, you connect with the world. Pura vida!

It certainly took me more time than I'd wished to set this blog up but finally here we are. I will permit myself a little bit of indulgence to pat my back and exclaim *well done!*

I have to warmly thank [@ezq](https://cardinali.org "Ezequiel Cardinali") who was the one who introduced me to this little cool dude that is [bashblog](https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog) last year when I attended the annual **FUDCon** (*Fedora Users and Developers Conference*) that was held in CÃ³rdoba, Argentina in the month of September.

**About this blog**                                                                 

* This blog is a kind of an open archive about IT and pretty much everything else that catches my attention
* It is a static blog, meaning it doesn't rely on any database or dynamic stuff like - *ughh* - JS and friends
* It is made using *bashblog*, a static site generator written in Bash.
* It is hosted at GitHub Pages ([go ahead and try it by yourself](https://pages.github.com "GitHub Pages"))
* Thanks to being a static blog and being hosted by the kind guys at GitHub it is mostly invulnerable against the dangers of the interwebs
* It is devilish fast to load since it is made of *markdown* and *HTML*
* Being light on resources as it is it won't suck your computer dry avid for CPU or GPU cycles and RAM
* I agree that my English sucks; on the bright side I'm actively working on getting better at it. If you see anything wrong please leave a comment :)

**A few rules to follow** (stop complaining, *some rules* are always necessary)                                  

* This blog is a place to learn, to share, to grow and to evolve
* When commenting try to not be a dick - no one likes self-proclaimed smart-asses
* Above all, **have phun!**

Fun fact: did you know that the answer to life and everything else isn't 42 as Mr. Adams incorrectly pointed out? In case you're wondering what is, it is **aliens** - *what else?*
