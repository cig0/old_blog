**About me**

Hi, my name's Martín Cigorraga, welcome to my corner on the 3w.                                                                                   
I'm a SysAdmin passionate about Unix(-like), automation, optimization, hardening and F/LOSS. Lately I started programming in [Go](https://golang.org); someday I would love to have the time to learn [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) and [Lisp](http://www.lispmachine.net).

*Background: I've been running [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.com) everywhere since February 2008 but in October 2014 I switched to [Fedora](https://getfedora.org) and I'm very happy with my desicion. My everyday toolkit consists of [tmux](https://tmux.github.io) + [tmuxinator](https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator), [fish](http://fishshell.com) + [autojump](https://github.com/wting/autojump) + [omf](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish) and [Spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org); among the GUI toolset there is FF + [DDG](https://www.duckduckgo.com), [Telegram](https://desktop.telegram.com) and [KeePass](https://keepass.info).*

Among many other things I love to surf. [Surfing is a state of mind](http://www.surfertoday.com/surfing/8267-the-best-surfing-quotes-of-all-time) - surfing is Zen in movement. When you surf, you connect with the world. *[Pura Vida](http://bestcostaricantours.com/about/puravida.html).*

**About this blog**                                                                 

It certainly took me more time than I'd wished to set up this blog but finally here we are. I will permit myself a little bit of indulgence to pat my back, sip some grog and appreciate my endeavor. Good job, me!

I have to warmly thank [@ezq](https://cardinali.org "Ezequiel Cardinali") who was the one who introduced me to this little cool dude that is [bashblog](https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog) last year when I attended to the **FUDCon 2015** (*Fedora Users and Developers Conference*) that was held in the month of September in Córdoba, Argentina. It was a fantastic event where I had the chance to meet the extraordinary people that conforms the Fedora community. *You're awesome guys.*

* This blog focuses on IT, yet don't be surprised to find entries about pretty much everything else that catches my attention
* It is a [static blog](https://www.staticgen.com), meaning it doesn't rely on any database or dynamic stuff (check [this](https://davidwalsh.name/introduction-static-site-generators) good article to learn more about the difference with dynamic websites)
* It is made using *bashblog*, a static site generator written in Bash (duh!)
* It is hosted at GitHub Pages ([go ahead and try it by yourself](https://pages.github.com "GitHub Pages"))
* Thanks to being a static blog and being hosted by the kind people at GitHub it is mostly invulnerable to the dangers of the interwebs
* It is devilish fast to load since it is made of just *markdown*, *HTML* and a little of *JS*
* Being light on resources as it is it won't suck your computer dry avid for CPU or GPU cycles and RAM
* I agree that I suck at English; on the bright side I'm actively working on getting better at it.
