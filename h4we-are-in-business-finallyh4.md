**About me**

Hi, I'm i90rr, welcome to my little corner on the 3w.                                                                                   
I'm a n3rd, I'm also a Unix(-like) SysAdmin passionate about automation, optimization, hardening and F/LOSS.  
Among many other things I love to surf. Surfing is a state of mind - like Zen. When you surf, you connect with the world. Pura vida!

**About this blog**                                                                 

It certainly took me more time than I'd wished to set up this blog but finally here we are. I will permit myself a little bit of indulgence to pat my back, sip some grog and exclaim *good job!*

I have to warmly thank [@ezq](https://cardinali.org "Ezequiel Cardinali") who was the one who introduced me to this little cool dude that is [bashblog](https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog) last year when I attended to the **FUDCon 2015** (*Fedora Users and Developers Conference*) that was held in September in CÃ³rdoba, Argentina. It was an extraordinary event of which I will be posting in the upcoming days.

* This blog's focus is on IT, yet don't be surprised to find entries about pretty much everything else that catches my attention
* It is a static blog, meaning it doesn't rely on any database or dynamic stuff like - *ughh* - JS and friends
* It is made using *bashblog*, a static site generator written in Bash.
* It is hosted at GitHub Pages ([go ahead and try it by yourself](https://pages.github.com "GitHub Pages"))
* Thanks to being a static blog and being hosted by the kind people at GitHub it is mostly invulnerable to the dangers of the interwebs
* It is devilish fast to load since it is made of *markdown* and *HTML*
* Being light on resources as it is it won't suck your computer dry avid for CPU or GPU cycles and RAM
* I agree that my English sucks; on the bright side I'm actively working on getting better at it. If you see anything wrong please leave a comment :)
* Last but not least: this blog is intended as an open hub to learn, to share, to grow and to evolve; more about this in the next section

**There's only a couple of rules to follow** (stop complaining, *some rules* are always necessary)                                  

* When commenting try to not be a dick - no one likes self-proclaimed smart-asses
* Above all, **have phun!**

Fun fact: did you know that the answer to life and everything else isn't 42 as Mr. Adams incorrectly pointed out?   
In case you're wondering what is, it is **aliens** - *what else?*
