We are in business (finally)

**About me**

I'm i90rr. I'm a n3rd. I'm also a SysAdmin, a Unix(-like) and F/LOSS admirer and contributor. If I were a religious person my religion would be surf. Surfing is a way of life, of being alive. When you surf, you connect with the world. Pura vida!

It certainly took me more time than I'd wished to set this blog up but finally here we are. I will permit myself a little bit of indulgence to pat my back and exclaim *well done!*

I have to warmly thank [@ezq](https://cardinali.org "Ezequiel Cardinali") who was the one who introduced me to this little cool dude that is [bashblog](https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog) last year when I attended the annual **FUDCon** (*Fedora Users and Developers Conference*) that was held in CÃ³rdoba, Argentina in the month of September.

**About this blog**

* An open archive about IT and pretty much everything else that catches my attention
* It is a static blog, meaning it doesn't rely on any database or dynamic stuff like - *ughh* - JS and friends
* It is made using *bashblog*, a static site generator written in Bash and hosted at GitHub ([go ahead and try it by yourself](https://pages.github.com "GitHub Pages"))
* Thanks to being a static blog and being hosted by the kind guys at GitHub it is mostly bulletproff against the dangers of the interwebs
* It is devilish fast to load since it is made of *markdown* and *HTML*

**A few rules** (stop complaining, *some rules* are always necessary)

* This blog is a place to learn, to share, to grow and to evolve
* When commenting try to not be a dick - no one likes self-proclaimed smart-asses
* Above all, **have phun!**

Fun fact: did you know that the answer to life and everything else isn't 42 as Mr. Adams incorrectly pointed out? In case you're wondering what is, it is **aliens** - *what else?*
