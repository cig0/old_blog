Sailing the CLIs of system administration depths

It certainly took me more than I'd wished to set up this blog but finally here I am =)
<br/>

**~# ls -l this\ blog/**

* Focuses on IT, yet don't be surprised to find entries about pretty much everything else that catches my attention
* Is made using [bashblog](https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog "Meet the little giant"), a static site generator written in Bourne-Again SHell
* Is a [static blog](https://www.staticgen.com), meaning it doesn't rely on any database or dynamic stuff (check [this article](https://davidwalsh.name/introduction-static-site-gener
ators) to learn more about the difference with dynamic websites)
* Is hosted at [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com "GitHub Pages") (many thanks!)
* Is hence mostly invulnerable to the dangers of the interwebs
* Is devilish fast to load since it is made using *Markdown*, *HTML*, *CSS* and just a pinch of *JS*
* Is hence light on resources so it won't suck your computer dry avid for {c,g}PU cycles and RAM
* Is written using the quite versatile [Atom Editor](https://www.atom.io) plus the useful package _[markdown-preview-plus](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview-plus)_
* Is named after my affinity to Finland, Finnish mythology, Finnish metal music and the fact that I live and breath IT infrastructure. [Tuonela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuonela) is the Underworld in Finnish mythology. It is also the name of an [excellent album by the Finnish band Amorphis](http://www.metal-archives.com/reviews/Amorphis/Tuonela/1/). I like Finland, I like metal and I work on IT infrastructure: `~# cd tuonela`

I'm a SysAdmin insanely passionate about automation, optimization, hardening, the Go programming language and of F/LOSS in general.

On the not techy side I enjoy outdoor activities - surf above everything else. Love to read and learn from the classics; all praises to Master Lovecraft. I believe that thanks to Tex Avery the world is a better place. Some day I will learn to play music or draw - I heard that one _has_ to develop at least one of such talents. Family, friends, my dogs are first to me. Oh and I'm on my way to stop eating animals (•̀ᴗ•́)و ̑̑

People stories and creations fuel my interest to see the world from unseen perspectives. In my book, every work should be a labour of love and passion because only then you can give the best of you.
