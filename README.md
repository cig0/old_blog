**About me**

Hi, I'm i90rr, welcome to my little corner on the 3w.                                                                                   
I'm a n3rd, I'm also a Unix(-like) SysAdmin passionate about automation, optimization, hardening and F/LOSS.  
Among many other things I love to surf. Surfing is a state of mind - like Zen. When you surf, you connect with the world. *Pura Vida.*

**About this blog**                                                                 

It certainly took me more time than I'd wished to set up this blog but finally here we are. I will permit myself a little bit of indulgence to pat my back, sip some grog and appreciate my endeavor. Good job, me!

I have to warmly thank [@ezq](https://cardinali.org "Ezequiel Cardinali") who was the one who introduced me to this little cool dude that is [bashblog](https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog) last year when I attended to the **FUDCon 2015** (*Fedora Users and Developers Conference*) that was held in the month of September in CÃ³rdoba, Argentina. It was a fantastic event where I had the chance to meet the extraordinary people that conforms the Fedora community. *You're awesome guys.*

* This blog focuses on IT, yet don't be surprised to find entries about pretty much everything else that catches my attention
* It is a [static blog](https://www.staticgen.com), meaning it doesn't rely on any database or dynamic stuff (check [this](https://davidwalsh.name/introduction-static-site-generators) good article to learn more about the difference with dynamic websites)
* It is made using *bashblog*, a static site generator written in Bash (duh!)
* It is hosted at GitHub Pages ([go ahead and try it by yourself](https://pages.github.com "GitHub Pages"))
* Thanks to being a static blog and being hosted by the kind people at GitHub it is mostly invulnerable to the dangers of the interwebs
* It is devilish fast to load since it is made of just *markdown*, *HTML* and a little of *JS*
* Being light on resources as it is it won't suck your computer dry avid for CPU or GPU cycles and RAM
* I agree that I suck at English; on the bright side I'm actively working on getting better at it.
