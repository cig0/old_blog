Git: keeping a GitHub fork updated

I keep coming back to this life-saviour post - a must when forking a project and creating pull requests - so I believe it is worth enough to have a _hard copy_ of it, just in case.

__Keeping A GitHub Fork Updated__ - _by Dan Croak_

I forked a GitHub repo thoughtbot/dotfiles to croaky/dotfiles and want to keep it updated.

**Track**

After I forked the repo to your Github account, I did this one time:

git clone git@github.com:croaky/dotfiles.git
<br>cd dotfiles
<br>git remote add upstream git@github.com:thoughtbot/dotfiles.git

**Update**

Each time I want to update, from my local master branch:

git fetch upstream
<br>git rebase upstream/master

The goal of the rebase is to have a cleaner history if I have local changes or commits on the repo. Itâ€™s the difference between the the left and the right in the image below:

<div style="margin: 0px auto; display: flex; justify-content: center;">
<a href="http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/11/pull-with-rebase.html">
   <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/i90rr/i90rr.github.io/master/resources/img/pull-rebase-vs-pull.jpg" border="0" />
</a>
</div>

**Commit rights upstream**

If I also have commit rights to the upstream repo, I can create a local upstream branch and do work that will go upstream there.

git checkout -b upstream upstream/master
