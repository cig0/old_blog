<h4>It's alive (finally!)</h4>
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p>I can't believe that it took me so much time to set this up.</p>

<p>I have to warmly thank <strong>Ezequiel</strong> who was the one who introduced me to BashBlog last year when I attended the annual FUDCon (Fedora Users and Developers Conference) that was held in Córdoba, Argentina in September. And talking about the event... what a nice memories, I was amazingly lucky to meet a lot of incredible folks. But enough for now, I will be writing about the FUDCon and what the Fedora community is all about in a later post - better later than never, right?</p>

<p>About me: n3rd. SysAdmin. Unix and F/LOSS lover. Surf 4 life, pura vida!</p>

<p>A final note: the answer to life and everything else isn't 42 as Mr. Douglas Adams incorrectly pointed out, it is <strong>aliens</strong>, as everybody knows.</p>
