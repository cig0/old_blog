<h4>We are in business (finally)</h4>
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p><strong>About me</strong></p>

<p>I'm i90rr. I'm a n3rd. I'm also a SysAdmin, a Unix(-like) and F/LOSS admirer and contributor. If I were a religious person my religion would be surf. Surfing is a way of life, of being alive. When you surf, you connect with the world. Pura vida!</p>

<p>It certainly took me more time than I'd wished to set this blog up but finally here we are. I will permit myself a little bit of indulgence to pat my back and exclaim <em>well done!</em></p>

<p>I have to warmly thank <a href="https://cardinali.org" title="Ezequiel Cardinali">@ezq</a> who was the one who introduced me to this little cool dude that is <a href="https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog">bashblog</a> last year when I attended the annual <strong>FUDCon</strong> (<em>Fedora Users and Developers Conference</em>) that was held in CÃ³rdoba, Argentina in the month of September.</p>

<p><strong>About this blog</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>An open archive about IT and pretty much everything else that catches my attention</li>
<li>It is a static blog, meaning it doesn't rely on any database or dynamic stuff like - <em>ughh</em> - JS and friends</li>
<li>It is made using <em>bashblog</em>, a static site generator written in Bash and hosted at GitHub (<a href="https://pages.github.com" title="GitHub Pages">go ahead and try it by yourself</a></li>
<li>Thanks to being a static blog and being hosted by the kind guys at GitHub it is mostly bulletproff against the dangers of the interwebs</li>
<li>It is devilish fast to load since it is made of <em>markdown</em> and <em>HTML</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A few rules</strong> (stop complaining, <em>some rules</em> are always necessary)</p>

<ul>
<li>This blog is a place to learn, to share, to grow and to evolve</li>
<li>When commenting try to not be a dick - no one likes self-proclaimed smart-asses</li>
<li>Above all, <strong>have phun!</strong></li>
</ul>
