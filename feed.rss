Coding in Go with Atom in GNU+Linux
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p>Today I will be sharing what I did to make Atom's third-party Go packages work with the default installation of the editor.</p>

<p>Lately I started to flirt with <a href="https://atom.io" title="A hackable text editor for the 21st Century">Atom</a> after my boss suggested me to give it a try for working with our Puppet infrastructure implementation (thanks for the tip Adam!).
Truth is that I already tried it in the past when it was at its early stages and while I saw at the time the project had a lot of potential there were too many issues, mainly related to performance, that pushed me away thus missing the opportynity of giving it a fair try - for the record, I'm an avid Emacs user and lately a <a href="http://spacemacs.org" title="A community-driven Emacs distribution - The best editor is neither Emacs nor Vim, it's Emacs *and* Vim!">Spacemacs</a> fan, more on it on an upcoming post. </p>

<p>Time went on and now Atom is a quite mature and feature-complete text editor. While it's difficult for me to digest the idea that it is in fact a Chromium-based web browser tweaked to work as a text editor, and nontheless how bloated it 'has' to be given its foundations regardless all work put into optimizing its performance, I can understand why the developers went this way: most of them (a vast majority in fact) are web-oriented developers, so to them this is a natural direction. Now, to be truthful, Atom 1.3.2 on my Fedora 23 system runs <em>incredible well</em>.
<strong>Excellent work guys!</strong></p>

<h4>Getting Atom's Go packages work with your penguin</h4>

<p>Atom has a big community that continuously adds new features in the form of plugins. Like with other programming languages there are some Go packages that can (and will) make a difference at the moment of diving into the editor and start hammering the keyboard. 
So far I found these third-party packages quite useful:
* go-config
* go-plus
* linter-golinter</p>

We are in business (finally)
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p><strong>About me</strong></p>

<p>I'm i90rr. I'm a n3rd. I'm also a SysAdmin, a Unix(-like) and F/LOSS admirer and contributor. If I were a religious person my religion would be surf. Surfing is a state of mind - like Zen. When you surf, you connect with the world. Pura vida!</p>

<p>It certainly took me more time than I'd wished to set this blog up but finally here we are. I will permit myself a little bit of indulgence to pat my back and exclaim <em>well done!</em></p>

<p>I have to warmly thank <a href="https://cardinali.org" title="Ezequiel Cardinali">@ezq</a> who was the one who introduced me to this little cool dude that is <a href="https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog">bashblog</a> last year when I attended the annual <strong>FUDCon</strong> (<em>Fedora Users and Developers Conference</em>) that was held in CÃ³rdoba, Argentina in the month of September.</p>

<p><strong>About this blog</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>An open archive about IT and pretty much everything else that catches my attention</li>
<li>It is a static blog, meaning it doesn't rely on any database or dynamic stuff like - <em>ughh</em> - JS and friends</li>
<li>It is made using <em>bashblog</em>, a static site generator written in Bash and hosted at GitHub (<a href="https://pages.github.com" title="GitHub Pages">go ahead and try it by yourself</a>)</li>
<li>Thanks to being a static blog and being hosted by the kind guys at GitHub it is mostly bulletproff against the dangers of the interwebs</li>
<li>It is devilish fast to load since it is made of <em>markdown</em> and <em>HTML</em></li>
<li>I agree that my English sucks; on the bright side I'm actively working on getting better at it. If you see anything wrong please leave a comment :)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A few rules</strong> (stop complaining, <em>some rules</em> are always necessary)</p>

<ul>
<li>This blog is a place to learn, to share, to grow and to evolve</li>
<li>When commenting try to not be a dick - no one likes self-proclaimed smart-asses</li>
<li>Above all, <strong>have phun!</strong></li>
</ul>
