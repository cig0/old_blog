<p><strong>About me</strong></p>

<p>Hi, I'm i90rr, welcome to my little corner on the 3w. <br />
I'm a n3rd, I'm also a Unix(-like) SysAdmin passionate about automation, optimization, hardening and F/LOSS. <br />
Among many other things I love to surf. Surfing is a state of mind - like Zen. When you surf, you connect with the world. <em>Pura Vida.</em></p>

<p><strong>About this blog</strong>                                                                 </p>

<p>It certainly took me more time than I'd wished to set up this blog but finally here we are. I will permit myself a little bit of indulgence to pat my back, sip some grog and appreciate my endeavor. Good job, me!</p>

<p>I have to warmly thank <a href="https://cardinali.org" title="Ezequiel Cardinali">@ezq</a> who was the one who introduced me to this little cool dude that is <a href="https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog">bashblog</a> last year when I attended to the <strong>FUDCon 2015</strong> (<em>Fedora Users and Developers Conference</em>) that was held in the month of September in CÃ³rdoba, Argentina. It was a fantastic event where I had the chance to meet the extraordinary people that conforms the Fedora community. <em>You're awesome guys.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>This blog focuses on IT, yet don't be surprised to find entries about pretty much everything else that catches my attention</li>
<li>It is a static blog, meaning it doesn't rely on any database or dynamic stuff like - <em>ughh</em> - JS and friends</li>
<li>It is made using <em>bashblog</em>, a static site generator written in Bash (duh!)</li>
<li>It is hosted at GitHub Pages (<a href="https://pages.github.com" title="GitHub Pages">go ahead and try it by yourself</a>)</li>
<li>Thanks to being a static blog and being hosted by the kind people at GitHub it is mostly invulnerable to the dangers of the interwebs</li>
<li>It is devilish fast to load since it is made of just <em>markdown</em> and <em>HTML</em></li>
<li>Being light on resources as it is it won't suck your computer dry avid for CPU or GPU cycles and RAM</li>
<li>I agree that my English sucks; on the bright side I'm actively working on getting better at it. If you see anything wrong please leave a comment :)</li>
<li>Last but not least: this blog is meant to be an open hub to learn, to share, to grow and to evolve</li>
</ul>

<p>( What takes us to... )</p>

<p><strong>There's a couple of rules to follow</strong> (Oh, stop it, stop complaining! <em>Some rules</em> are always necessary)</p>

<ul>
<li>When commenting try not to be a dick - nobody likes smart-asses         </li>
<li>Have fun!</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>Fun fact: did you know that the answer to life and everything else isn't 42 as Mr. Adams incorrectly pointed out? <br />
In case you're wondering what is, it is <strong>aliens</strong> - <em>what else?</em></p>
