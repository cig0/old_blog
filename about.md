About

It certainly took me more than I'd wished to set up this blog but finally here I am =)
<br/>

**~# ls -l this\ blog/**

* Focuses on IT, yet don't be surprised to find entries about pretty much everything else that catches my attention
* Is made using [bashblog](https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog "Meet the little giant"), a beautifully crafted static site generator written in Bourne-Again SHell
* Is a [static blog](https://www.staticgen.com), meaning it doesn't rely on any database or dynamic stuff; check [this neat article](https://davidwalsh.name/introduction-static-site-generators) to learn more about the difference with dynamic websites/webApps
* Is hosted at [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com "GitHub Pages") (many thanks!)
* Is hence mostly invulnerable to the dangers of the interwebs
* Is devilish fast to load since it is made using *Markdown*, *HTML*, *CSS* and just a pinch of *JS*
* Is hence light on resources so it won't suck your computer dry avid for {c,g}PU cycles and RAM
* Is written using the quite versatile [Atom Editor](https://www.atom.io) plus the useful package _[markdown-preview-plus](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview-plus)_
* Is named after my affinity to Finland, Finnish mythology, Finnish metal music and the fact that I live and breath IT infrastructure. [Tuonela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuonela) is the Underworld in Finnish mythology. It is also the name of an [excellent album by the Finnish band Amorphis](http://www.metal-archives.com/reviews/Amorphis/Tuonela/1/). I like Finland, I like metal and I work on IT infrastructure: `~# cd tuonela`

I'm a SysAdmin insanely passionate about automation, orchestration, optimization,  hardening and F/LOSS in general.

I also like to code my own tools for which I mostly use Python although I'm more on the side of Go, Rust and lately Swift. Lisp and Haskell also draw my attention...

On the not techy side I enjoy outdoor activities - surf above everything else. Love to read and learn from the classics; all praises to Master Lovecraft. I believe that thanks to Tex Avery the world is a better place. Some day I will learn to play music or draw - I heard that one _has_ to develop at least one of such talents. Family, friends, my dogs are first to me. Oh and I'm on my way to stop eating animals (•̀ᴗ•́)و ̑̑

I'm naturally avid about people's stories and creations as they fuel my interest to see the world from unseen - and sometimes quite unique - perspectives. In my book every work should be the labour of love and passion because only then you can give the best out of you.

I also have to thank [@ezq](https://cardinali.org/) for re-introducing me to bashblog at the awesome [Fedora's](https://www.fedoraproject.org) [FUDCon 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPYX8o-m19s) which was held in [Córdoba, Argentina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%B3rdoba_Province,_Argentina). The people I met there is simply incredible and those fond memories will stay with me forever.
