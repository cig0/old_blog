We are in business, finally! (aka About)

It certainly took me more time than I'd wished to set up this blog but finally here we are.

**This blog**...

* Focuses on IT, yet don't be surprised to find entries about pretty much everything else that catches my attention
* Is made using [bashblog](https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog "Meet the little giant"), a static site generator written in... Bash (duh!)
* Is a [static blog](https://www.staticgen.com), meaning it doesn't rely on any database or dynamic stuff (check [this good article](https://davidwalsh.name/introduction-static-site-generators) to learn more about the difference with dynamic websites)
* Is hosted at [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com "GitHub Pages")
* Is hence mostly invulnerable to the dangers of the interwebs
* Is devilish fast to load since it is made of *Markdown*, *HTML* and just a pinch of *JS*
* Is hence light on resources so it won't suck your computer dry avid for {c,g}PU cycles and RAM to show its contents

I agree that I suck at English; on the bright side I'm actively working on getting better at it. If you see anything wrong please leave a comment :)

**The boring stuff**

I'm a SysAdmin insanely passionate about automation, optimization, hardening, the Go programming language and of F/LOSS in general.

People stories and their creations fuel my interest to see the world from unseen perspectives. I believe that every work should be a labour of love, because only then you can bring your full potential to what you do.
