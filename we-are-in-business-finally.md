We are in business, finally (aka About)

It certainly took me more than I'd wished to set up this blog but finally here I am!

**This blog**...

* Focuses on IT, yet don't be surprised to find entries about pretty much everything else that can catch my attention
* Is made using [bashblog](https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog "Meet the little giant"), a static site generator written in Bourne-Again SHell
* Is a [static blog](https://www.staticgen.com), meaning it doesn't rely on any database or dynamic stuff (check [this article](https://davidwalsh.name/introduction-static-site-generators) to learn more about the difference with dynamic websites)
* Is hosted at [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com "GitHub Pages")
* Is hence mostly invulnerable to the dangers of the interwebs
* Is devilish fast to load since it is made using *Markdown*, *HTML*, *CSS* and just a pinch of *JS*
* Is hence light on resources so it won't suck your computer dry avid for {c,g}PU cycles and RAM

Note: I agree that I suck at English; on the bright side I'm actively working on getting better at it so please be patient :)

**The boring stuff**

I'm a SysAdmin insanely passionate about automation, optimization, hardening, the Go programming language and of F/LOSS in general.

On the not techy side I enjoy outdoor activities - surf above everything else. Love to read and learn from the classics, Latins and Greeks are usually my tops. Said that, all praises to Master Lovecraft. I believe that thanks to Tex Avery the world is a better place. Some day I will learn to play music or draw - I heard that one _has_ to develop at least one of such talents.
<br/>Family, friends, my dogs are first to me.
<br/>Oh and I'm on my way to stop eating animals :)

People stories and creations fuel my interest to see the world from unseen perspectives. In my book, every work should be a labour of love and passion because only then you can give the best of you.
