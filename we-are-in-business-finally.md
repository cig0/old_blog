We are in business, finally (aka About)

It certainly took me more than I'd wished to set up this blog but finally here I am!

**About blog's name**
<br/>[Tuonela is the Underworld in Finnish mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuonela). It is also the name of an [excellent album by the Finnish band Amorphis](http://www.metal-archives.com/reviews/Amorphis/Tuonela/1/). I like Finland, I like metal and I work on IT infrastructure -- do the maths.

* -rw-r--r--  1 i90rr i90rr 113 Jan  1 16:08 Focused on IT, yet don't be surprised to find entries about pretty much everything else that catches my attention
* -rw-r--r--  1 i90rr i90rr 143 Jan  1 16:08 Is made using [bashblog](https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog "Meet the little giant"), a static site generator written in Bourne-Again SHell
* -rw-r--r--  1 i90rr i90rr 244 Jan  1 16:08 Is a [static blog](https://www.staticgen.com), meaning it doesn't rely on any database or dynamic stuff (check [this article](https://davidwalsh.name/introduction-static-site-generators) to learn more about the difference with dynamic websites)
* -rw-r--r--  1 i90rr i90rr  83 Jan  1 16:08 Is hosted at [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com "GitHub Pages") (many thanks!)
* -rw-r--r--  1 i90rr i90rr  60 Jan  1 16:08 Is hence mostly invulnerable to the dangers of the interwebs
* -rw-r--r--  1 i90rr i90rr  98 Jan  1 16:08 Is devilish fast to load since it is made using *Markdown*, *HTML*, *CSS* and just a pinch of *JS*
* -rw-r--r--  1 i90rr i90rr  94 Jan  1 16:08 Is hence light on resources so it won't suck your computer dry avid for {c,g}PU cycles and RAM
```
Note: I agree that I suck at English; on the bright side I'm actively working on getting better at it so please be patient :)

**The boring stuff**

I'm a SysAdmin insanely passionate about automation, optimization, hardening, the Go programming language and of F/LOSS in general.

On the not techy side I enjoy outdoor activities - surf above everything else. Love to read and learn from the classics, Latins and Greeks are usually my tops. Said that, all praises to Master Lovecraft. I believe that thanks to Tex Avery the world is a better place. Some day I will learn to play music or draw - I heard that one _has_ to develop at least one of such talents.
<br/>Family, friends, my dogs are first to me.
<br/>Oh and I'm on my way to stop eating animals (•̀ᴗ•́)و ̑̑

People stories and creations fuel my interest to see the world from unseen perspectives. In my book, every work should be a labour of love and passion because only then you can give the best of you.
