**About me**

I'm a [SysAdmin](https://xkcd.com/705) passionate about Unix(-like), automation, optimization, hardening and F/LOSS. Lately I started programming in [Go](https://golang.org); someday I would love to have the time to learn [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) and [Lisp](http://www.lispmachine.net).

Whenever I have time I love to surf, [pura vida](http://bestcostaricantours.com/about/puravida.html)!

**About this blog**                                                                 

It certainly took me more time than I'd wished to set up this blog but finally here we are.

* This blog focuses on IT, yet don't be surprised to find entries about pretty much everything else that catches my attention
* It is a [static blog](https://www.staticgen.com), meaning it doesn't rely on any database or dynamic stuff (check [this good article](https://davidwalsh.name/introduction-static-site-generators) to learn more about the difference with dynamic websites)
* It is made using *bashblog*, a static site generator written in Bash (duh!)
* It is hosted at GitHub Pages ([go ahead and try it by yourself](https://pages.github.com "GitHub Pages"))
* Thanks to being a static blog and being hosted by the kind people at GitHub it is mostly invulnerable to the dangers of the interwebs
* It is devilish fast to load since it is made of just *markdown*, *HTML* and a pinch of *JS*
* Being light on resources as it is it won't suck your computer dry avid for CPU and GPU cycles and memory
* I agree that I suck at English; on the bright side I'm actively working on getting better at it.
