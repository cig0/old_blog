We are in business, finally! (aka About)

**About the blog**                                                                 

It certainly took me more time than I'd wished to set up this blog but finally here we are.

* This blog focuses on IT, yet don't be surprised to find entries about pretty much everything else that catches my attention
* It is a [static blog](https://www.staticgen.com), meaning it doesn't rely on any database or dynamic stuff (check [this good article](https://davidwalsh.name/introduction-static-site-generators) to learn more about the difference with dynamic websites)
* It is made using [bashblog](https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog "Meet the little giant"), a static site generator written in... Bash (duh!)
* It is hosted at [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com "GitHub Pages")
* Thanks to being a static blog and being hosted at GitHub it is mostly invulnerable to the dangers of the interwebs
* It is devilish fast to load since it is made of just *Markdown*, *HTML* and a pinch of *JS*
* Being light on resources as it is it won't suck your computer dry avid for CPU and GPU cycles and memory
* I agree that I suck at English; on the bright side I'm actively working on getting better at it.

**The boring stuff**

I'm a SysAdmin insanely passionate about automation, optimization, hardening, the Go programming language and of F/LOSS in general.

People stories and their creations fuel my interest to see the world from unseen perspectives. I believe that every work should be a labour of love, because only then you can bring your full potential to what you do.
