Coding in Go with Atom editor on GNU+Linux
</a></h3>
<div class="subtitle">January 18, 2016 &mdash;

<!-- text begin -->

<p>I started to flirt with <a href="https://atom.io" title="A hackable text editor for the 21st Century">Atom</a> after my boss suggested me to give it a try for working with our Puppet infrastructure implementation - thanks for the tip Adam!</p>

<p>Truth is that I have tried Atom in the past when it was at its early stages and while I saw at the time the project had a lot of potential there were too many issues, mainly related to performance, that pushed me away of it thus missing the opportunity to give it a fair try - for the record, I'm an avid Emacs user and lately a <a href="http://spacemacs.org" title="A community-driven Emacs distribution - The best editor is neither Emacs nor Vim, it's Emacs *and* Vim!">Spacemacs</a> fan, more on it on an upcoming post. </p>

<p>Time went on and now Atom is a quite mature and feature-complete text editor. While it's difficult for me to digest the idea that it is in fact a Chromium-based web browser tweaked to work as a text editor, and nontheless how bloated it "has" to be given its foundations and regardless all the work being done to optimize its performance, I can understand why the developers went this way: given its roots I suppose that most of them if not the vast majority are web-oriented developers, so to them this is a natural direction. Now, to be truthful, Atom 1.3.2 on my Fedora 23 system <em>runs incredible snappy</em>.</p>

<p>Atom has a big community that continuously adds new features in the form of plugins. As with other programming languages there are some Go packages that can (and will) make a difference at the moment of diving into the editor to start hammering the keyboard. </p>

<p>So far I found these two third-party packages very useful:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>go-config</strong>: detects installed Go runtime(s), tools and configurations making them available for use by other packages</li>
<li><strong>go-plus</strong>: adds 'gocode', 'gofmt', 'goimports', 'go vet', 'golint', 'go build' and 'go test' functionality for the Go language</li>
</ul>

<p>They both install well, but making them work is a different story.</p>

<p><strong>About me</strong></p>

<p>Welcome to my corner on the 3w.</br>
I'm a SysAdmin passionate about Unix(-like), automation, optimization, hardening and F/LOSS. Lately I started programming in <a href="https://golang.org">Go</a>; someday I would love to have the time to learn <a href="https://rust-lang.org">Rust</a> and <a href="http://www.lispmachine.net">Lisp</a>.</p>

<p><em>I've been running <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Linux#Principles">Arch Linux</a> everywhere since February 2008 but in October 2014 I switched to <a href="https://getfedora.org">Fedora</a> and I'm very happy with my desicion. My everyday toolkit consists of <a href="https://tmux.github.io">tmux</a> + <a href="https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator">tmuxinator</a>, <a href="http://fishshell.com">fish</a> + <a href="https://github.com/wting/autojump">autojump</a> + <a href="https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish">omf</a> and Emacs (<a href="http://spacemacs.org">Spacemacs</a> - thanks E1NS!); among the GUI toolset there is FF + <a href="https://www.duckduckgo.com">DDG</a>, <a href="https://desktop.telegram.com">Telegram</a> and <a href="https://keepass.info">KeePass</a>.</em></p>

<p>Among many other things I love to surf. <a href="http://www.surfertoday.com/surfing/8267-the-best-surfing-quotes-of-all-time">Surfing</a> is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACMckXr1j4o">state of mind</a> - surfing is Zen in movement.</br>
When you surf, you connect with the world. <a href="http://bestcostaricantours.com/about/puravida.html">Pura Vida</a>.</p>

<p><strong>About this blog</strong>                                                                 </p>

<p>It certainly took me more time than I'd wished to set up this blog but finally here we are. Now it's time to relax - and you know what that means: a sip of grog, your favorite easy chair and of course <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-BXxX1x4y8">this album playing on YT</a>.</p>

<p>I have to thank <a href="https://cardinali.org" title="Ezequiel Cardinali">@ezq</a> who was the one who introduced me to this little cool dude that is <a href="https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog">bashblog</a> last year when I attended to the <strong>FUDCon 2015</strong> (<em>Fedora Users and Developers Conference</em>) that was held in the month of September in CÃ³rdoba, Argentina. It was a fantastic experience where I had the chance to meet the extraordinary people that conforms the Fedora community. <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPYX8o-m19s">You're awesome guys</a></strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>This blog focuses on IT, yet don't be surprised to find entries about pretty much everything else that catches my attention</li>
<li>It is a <a href="https://www.staticgen.com">static blog</a>, meaning it doesn't rely on any database or dynamic stuff (check <a href="https://davidwalsh.name/introduction-static-site-generators">this</a> good article to learn more about the difference with dynamic websites)</li>
<li>It is made using <em>bashblog</em>, a static site generator written in Bash (duh!)</li>
<li>It is hosted at GitHub Pages (<a href="https://pages.github.com" title="GitHub Pages">go ahead and try it by yourself</a>)</li>
<li>Thanks to being a static blog and being hosted by the kind people at GitHub it is mostly invulnerable to the dangers of the interwebs</li>
<li>It is devilish fast to load since it is made of just <em>markdown</em>, <em>HTML</em> and a little of <em>JS</em></li>
<li>Being light on resources as it is it won't suck your computer dry avid for CPU or GPU cycles and RAM</li>
<li>I agree that I suck at English; on the bright side I'm actively working on getting better at it. <br />
If you see anything wrong please leave a comment :)</li>
