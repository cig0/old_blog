Coding in Go with Atom in GNU+Linux

Lately I started to flirt with [Atom](https://atom.io "A hackable text editor for the 21st Century") after my boss suggested me to give it a try for working with our Puppet infrastructure implementation.
Truth is that I already tried it in the past when it was on its early stages and while I saw at the time the project had a lot of potential there were too many issues - mainly performance - that pushed me away of giving it a fair try - for the record, I'm an avid Emacs user and lately a [Spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org "A community-driven Emacs distribution - The best editor is neither Emacs nor Vim, it's Emacs *and* Vim!") fan, more on it in an upcoming post. 

Time went on and now Atom is a quite mature and feature-complete text editor. While it's difficult for me to digest the idea that it is in fact a Chromium-based web browser tweaked to work as a text editor, and nontheless how bloated it 'has' to be given its foundations regardless all work put into optimizing its performance, I can understand why the developers went this way: most of them (a vast majority in fact) are web-oriented developers, so to them this is a natural direction. Now, to be truthful, Atom 1.3.2 on my Fedora 23 system works *incredible well*.
**Excellent work guys!**
