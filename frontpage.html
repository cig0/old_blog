<h4>Head-to-toe guide for registering an account<br>+ SASL + cloaking + SSL + OTR</h4>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/i90rr/i90rr.github.io/master/resources/img/weechat.png" border="0"  align="left" style="margin-right: 17px">
This guide shows you how to implement a private <em>person-to-person</em> communication channel in freenode <br>to safely avoid server logging of your chats.
<br><br></p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>There are plenty of ways to securely chat online, however if you spend most of your time in freenode and indeed the people you chat with is there this method will help you establish a secure, private channel for a person-to-person communication. </p>

<p>While this guide is focused on freenode and WeeChat it should be trivial to adapt it to other networks and clients.

It certainly took me more than I'd wished to set up this blog but finally here I am =)</p>

<p><strong>~# ls -l this\ blog/</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Focuses on IT, yet don't be surprised to find entries about pretty much everything else that catches my attention</li>
<li>Is made using <a href="https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog" title="Meet the little giant">bashblog</a>, a beautifully crafted static site generator written in Bourne-Again SHell</li>
<li>Is a <a href="https://www.staticgen.com">static blog</a>, meaning it doesn't rely on any database or dynamic stuff; check <a href="https://davidwalsh.name/introduction-static-site-generators">this neat article</a> to learn more about the difference with dynamic websites/webApps</li>
<li>Is hosted at <a href="https://pages.github.com" title="GitHub Pages">GitHub Pages</a> (many thanks!)</li>
<li>Is hence mostly invulnerable to the dangers of the interwebs</li>
<li>Is devilish fast to load since it is made using <em>Markdown</em>, <em>HTML</em>, <em>CSS</em> and just a pinch of <em>JS</em></li>
<li>Is hence light on resources so it won't suck your computer dry avid for {c,g}PU cycles and RAM</li>
<li>Is written using the quite versatile <a href="https://www.atom.io">Atom Editor</a> plus the useful package <em><a href="https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview-plus">markdown-preview-plus</a></em></li>
<li>Is named after my affinity to Finland, Finnish mythology, Finnish metal music and the fact that I live and breath IT infrastructure. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuonela">Tuonela</a> is the Underworld in Finnish mythology. It is also the name of an <a href="http://www.metal-archives.com/reviews/Amorphis/Tuonela/1/">excellent album by the Finnish band Amorphis</a>. I like Finland, I like metal and I work on IT infrastructure: <code>~# cd tuonela</code></li>

<p>I'm a SysAdmin insanely passionate about automation, orchestration, optimization,  hardening and F/LOSS in general.</p>

<p>I also like to code my own tools for which I mostly use Python although I'm more on the side of Go, Rust and lately Swift. Lisp and Haskell also draw my attention...</p>

<p>On the not techy side I enjoy outdoor activities - surf above everything else. Love to read and learn from the classics; all praises to Master Lovecraft. I believe that thanks to Tex Avery the world is a better place. Some day I will learn to play music or draw - I heard that one <em>has</em> to develop at least one of such talents. Family, friends, my dogs are first to me. Oh and I'm on my way to stop eating animals (•̀ᴗ•́)و ̑̑</p>

<p>I'm naturally avid about people's stories and creations as they fuel my interest to see the world from unseen - and sometimes quite unique - perspectives. In my book every work should be the labour of love and passion because only then you can give the best out of you.</p>

Coding in Go with Atom editor on GNU+Linux

<p>I started to flirt with <a href="https://atom.io" title="A hackable text editor for the 21st Century">Atom</a> after my boss suggested me to give it a try for working with our Puppet infrastructure implementation - thanks for the tip Adam!</p>

<p>Truth is that I have tried Atom in the past when it was at its early stages and while I saw at the time the project had a lot of potential there were too many issues, mainly related to performance, that pushed me away of it thus missing the opportunity to give it a fair try - for the record, I'm an avid Emacs user and lately a <a href="http://spacemacs.org" title="A community-driven Emacs distribution - The best editor is neither Emacs nor Vim, it's Emacs *and* Vim!">Spacemacs</a> fan, more on it on an upcoming post. </p>

<p>Time went on and now Atom is a quite mature and feature-complete text editor. While it's difficult for me to digest the idea that it is in fact a Chromium-based web browser tweaked to work as a text editor, and nontheless how bloated it "has" to be given its foundations and regardless all the work being done to optimize its performance, I can understand why the developers went this way: given its roots I suppose that most of them if not the vast majority are web-oriented developers, so to them this is a natural direction. Now, to be truthful, Atom 1.3.2 on my Fedora 23 system <em>runs incredible snappy</em>.</p>

<p>Atom has a big community that continuously adds new features in the form of plugins. As with other programming languages there are some Go packages that can (and will) make a difference at the moment of diving into the editor to start hammering the keyboard. </p>

<p>So far I found these two third-party packages very useful:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>go-config</strong>: detects installed Go runtime(s), tools and configurations making them available for use by other packages</li>
<li><strong>go-plus</strong>: adds 'gocode', 'gofmt', 'goimports', 'go vet', 'golint', 'go build' and 'go test' functionality for the Go language</li>
</ul>

<p>They both install well, but making them work is a different story.
