<p>It certainly took me more time than I'd wished to set up the blog but finally here we are.</p>

<p><strong>This blog</strong>...</p>

<ul>
<li>Focuses on IT, yet don't be surprised to find entries about pretty much everything else that catches my attention</li>
<li>Is made using <a href="https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog" title="Meet the little giant">bashblog</a>, a static site generator written in... Bash (duh!)</li>
<li>Is a <a href="https://www.staticgen.com">static blog</a>, meaning it doesn't rely on any database or dynamic stuff (check <a href="https://davidwalsh.name/introduction-static-site-generators">this article</a> to learn more about the difference with dynamic websites)</li>
<li>Is hosted at <a href="https://pages.github.com" title="GitHub Pages">GitHub Pages</a></li>
<li>Is hence mostly invulnerable to the dangers of the interwebs</li>
<li>Is devilish fast to load since it is made of <em>Markdown</em>, <em>HTML</em>, <em>CSS</em> and just a pinch of <em>JS</em></li>
<li>Is hence light on resources so it won't suck your computer dry avid for {c,g}PU cycles and RAM</li>
</ul>

<p>I agree that I suck at English; on the bright side I'm actively working on getting better at it.

<p><strong>The boring stuff</strong></p>

<p>I'm a SysAdmin insanely passionate about automation, optimization, hardening, the Go programming language and of F/LOSS in general.</p>

<p>People stories and their creations fuel my interest to see the world from unseen perspectives. In my book, every work should be a labour of love because only then you can give the best of you.</p>

<h3><a class="ablack" href="something-fishy-happening-here.html">
Fish shell: finally, a command line shell for the 90's
</a></h3>
<div class="subtitle">February 19, 2016 &mdash;

<!-- text begin -->

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: small;">This is an old post I'm reproducing here as part of my old blog migration. Since I wrote this post<br>I changed my habits quite a bit but the article is still valid as last time I checked using Fish as the default shell<br>in my Fedora 23 system I couldn't log into the X session</p>

<p style="font-size: x-large; text-align: center;">Why you shouldn't set <a href="https://www.fishshell.com">Fish</a> as the default shell
<br><span style="font-size: large;">Tip: it's ok though to set it as your <b>primary</b> shell</span>
</p>

<p>When I decided barely a month ago to finally move from Bash to Zsh I did remember about Fish, a shell I had tried in the past but ultimately left to test later as I didn't had the time at that opportunity to dive into it the way I pretended.</p>

<p>When I finally got a whole weekend for a n3rd sprint I deeply, desperately, passionately and unconditionally fell in love with Fish.</p>

<p>Right straight after reading Fish's website I could sense this would be the beginning of something special, as reading about it's design argument I felt the same way as when I read about <a href="">The Arch Way</a> some years ago and fell in love with the distro.</p>

<p>I believe the best way I can present this Friendly Interactive Shell is by describing it as <strong>an intelligent shell that works as an extension of the user in an organic and natural way</strong>:</p>

<h3><a class="ablack" href="coding-in-go-with-atom-in-gnulinux.html">
Coding in Go with Atom editor on GNU+Linux
</a></h3>
<div class="subtitle">January 06, 2016 &mdash; 
Martín Cigorraga</div>
<!-- text begin -->

<p>I started to flirt with <a href="https://atom.io" title="A hackable text editor for the 21st Century">Atom</a> after my boss suggested me to give it a try for working with our Puppet infrastructure implementation - thanks for the tip Adam!</p>

<p>Truth is that I have tried Atom in the past when it was at its early stages and while I saw at the time the project had a lot of potential there were too many issues, mainly related to performance, that pushed me away of it thus missing the opportunity to give it a fair try - for the record, I'm an avid Emacs user and lately a <a href="http://spacemacs.org" title="A community-driven Emacs distribution - The best editor is neither Emacs nor Vim, it's Emacs *and* Vim!">Spacemacs</a> fan, more on it on an upcoming post. </p>

<p>Time went on and now Atom is a quite mature and feature-complete text editor. While it's difficult for me to digest the idea that it is in fact a Chromium-based web browser tweaked to work as a text editor, and nontheless how bloated it "has" to be given its foundations and regardless all the work being done to optimize its performance, I can understand why the developers went this way: given its roots I suppose that most of them if not the vast majority are web-oriented developers, so to them this is a natural direction. Now, to be truthful, Atom 1.3.2 on my Fedora 23 system <em>runs incredible snappy</em>.</p>

<p>Atom has a big community that continuously adds new features in the form of plugins. As with other programming languages there are some Go packages that can (and will) make a difference at the moment of diving into the editor to start hammering the keyboard. </p>

<p>So far I found these two third-party packages very useful:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>go-config</strong>: detects installed Go runtime(s), tools and configurations making them available for use by other packages</li>
<li><strong>go-plus</strong>: adds 'gocode', 'gofmt', 'goimports', 'go vet', 'golint', 'go build' and 'go test' functionality for the Go language</li>
</ul>

<p>They both install well, but making them work is a different story.
