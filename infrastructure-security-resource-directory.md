Infrastructure security resource directory

At the time of writing this entry I'm still unable to find a bookmark system for web resources that doesn't suck. Because inter-browser bookmark sharing is cumbersone (at best) I will keep this post updated with the neat stuff I cross paths in my search of information on the topic.

My goal for this post is that it can serve as a memory helper for myself as well a curated directory for anybody else looking for the same information. Since I already spent time looking for the information provided here I hope you won't have to :)

As with any other directory, list or group of lists of any kind, wording and presentation of the data is hightly subjective and will vary from person to person -- let alone sorting criteria.
<br/>Feel free to use the ```Find...``` function of your browser to quickly find want you're looking for.

One last thing about how information is presented:
<br/>I will try to add just the original URL/URI whenever it's possible simply because some resources are self-explanatory, like the ones from GitHub.
<br/>With rather obscure endpoints I might present the linked information in an embellished form for the sake of readability.
